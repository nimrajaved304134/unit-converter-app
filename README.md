# Unit Converter App - Innovation Roadmap

## Overview
This project is a feature-rich unit converter app built using Python and Streamlit. The goal is to enhance the app with innovative functionalities that improve usability, accessibility, and efficiency. Over the course of a week, we will implement two new features per day, gradually transforming the app into an advanced and interactive tool.

## Innovation Schedule

### **Day 1: Smart Instant Search & Conversion History**
1. **Smart Instant Search**
   - Add a search bar that dynamically filters both categories and units as you type.
   - Implement auto-complete suggestions for units.
---

### **Day 2: Visual Representation & Customizable Units**
2. **Conversion History**
   - Add a session state-based history feature to track recent conversions.
   - Allow users to quickly reuse previous conversions with a single click.
     
3. **Visual Representation**
   - Add charts or scales that visually show the relative magnitudes of different units.
   - For example, display how many cups fit in a gallon using a visual diagram.


---

### **Day 3: Unit Comparison Mode & Offline Capability**
4. **Unit Comparison Mode**
   - Add a mode that shows multiple equivalent values at once.
   - Example: Display 1 meter in all length units simultaneously.

5. **Offline Capability**
   - Add caching to make the app work offline after the first load.
   - Include a downloadable version for desktop use.

---

### **Day 4: Voice Input/Output & AR Integration**
6. **Voice Input/Output**
   - Add speech recognition for hands-free conversion.
   - Implement text-to-speech for result announcements.

9. **AR Integration (Mobile Only)**
   - Integrate the camera to measure real objects.
   - Allow users to point the camera at text containing measurements for auto-conversion.

---

### **Day 5: Interactive Education Mode & Currency Conversion**
10. **Interactive Education Mode**
   - Add short animations explaining the relationship between units.
   - Include quiz functionality to help users learn common conversions.

11. **Currency Conversion**
    - Add real-time currency conversion with API integration.
    - Include historical rate charts.

---

### **Day 6: Multi-Step Conversion Calculator & Dark/Light Mode**
12. **Multi-Step Conversion Calculator**
    - Allow users to build formulas with multiple unit types.
    - Example: "How many gallons of water to fill a box measuring 2ft Ã— 3ft Ã— 4ft?"

13. **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**
    - Add theme customization options.
    - Include accessibility features for color-blind users.

---

### **Day 7: Contextual Information & Sharing Features**
14. **Contextual Information**
    - Display interesting facts about units (e.g., "Did you know a league was originally the distance a person could walk in an hour?").
    - Include practical examples (e.g., "5 gallons is about the size of a standard water cooler bottle").

15. **One-Click Copy & Share**
    - Add buttons to copy results or share conversions via URL.
    - Generate shareable images of conversion results.

---

### **Bonus Feature: Localization**
16. **Localization Features** (Future Improvement)
    - Allow toggling between different regional units (US/UK/Metric systems).
    - Support multiple languages.

## Getting Started
To run the project locally:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
